# Flight Price Prediction: A Data Science Project

This repository contains our team's work on predicting flight prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset, which can be found here, is the result of web scraping the booking website "Ease My Trip" and includes information about the price and characteristics of flights between various Indian cities in 2022.

## Repository Contents

- **Data Cleaning and Exploration**: We took on the challenge of cleaning the data ourselves, rather than using a pre-cleaned dataset. This allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the data and ensure it was prepared to our exact specifications. We then performed an exploratory data analysis to understand the factors affecting the price of the tickets.

- **Model Building**: We built predictive models using various techniques. Our primary approach was to use multilinear models with both One Hot Encoding and Label Encoding. We also performed a multicollinearity analysis to refine our models. As an alternative, we employed a Random Forest model.

- **Classification Techniques**: In addition to regression models, we also explored classification techniques. We used a Single Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifiers, and conducted a Clustering Analysis.

Our project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data science, from data cleaning and exploration to building and refining predictive models. We hope that our work can provide valuable insights into the factors affecting flight prices.
